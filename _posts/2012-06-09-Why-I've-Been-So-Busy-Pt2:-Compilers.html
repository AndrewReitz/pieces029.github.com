Took my a while to get time to write this up. &nbsp;I've been busy moving stuff and getting back to work now that schools out. &nbsp;Anyways, I took a compilers course last semester, it was a lot of work but it was fun and I learned a lot. &nbsp;I mainly took it because of this blog post&nbsp;<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html</a>&nbsp;that was in Hacker Monthly. &nbsp;After reading it I was all about taking compilers. &nbsp;Then a month went by and it was time to sign up for classes. &nbsp;I almost didn't take compilers, in fact I had to read the article again to convince myself to. &nbsp;I am glad I did. &nbsp;I have a better understanding how they work, and what errors mean just to name a few things.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Anyways, in the class we made our own interpreter for a&nbsp;language&nbsp;KLOGO, specified by the professor. &nbsp;It is a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">logo</a>" like&nbsp;language, in that it interprets your&nbsp;commands&nbsp;and moves a turtle around to draw a picture. &nbsp;We used flex and bison for our parser/scanner&nbsp;respectively&nbsp;and the graphics professor at my school programed the graphics part we were to interface with. &nbsp;After the scanning and parsing an AST was produced, that was type checked and finally executed the code. &nbsp;It sounds pretty simple when I say it now, but it was a lot of work. &nbsp;Below is an image of my interpreter interpreting a&nbsp;program&nbsp;I made. &nbsp;It demonstrates most features of the interpreter. &nbsp;Note: the output in the terminal was to demonstrate to the&nbsp;professor&nbsp;that it actually was working, and not just an image I drew.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QlYCB2RIaGg/TdcJI03dJQI/AAAAAAAAACk/zF6JlGVyZBI/s1600/Screenshot.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QlYCB2RIaGg/TdcJI03dJQI/AAAAAAAAACk/zF6JlGVyZBI/s320/Screenshot.png" width="217" /></a></div><div><br /></div>
