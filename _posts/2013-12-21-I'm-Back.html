I haven't posted in a while, but I have decided to come back. &nbsp;I was trying to create my own blog using Symfony CMF using the BlogBundle, but it isn't quite baked yet. I am working on updating my website from node.js using express to use Symfony CMF. &nbsp;So far it's been an interesting experience. &nbsp;I had to learn PHP, then Symfony, and finally the CMF. &nbsp;Anyways, hope to be posting more soon!<br /><br />-Andrew
