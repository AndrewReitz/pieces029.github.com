I have officially switched all my main computers over to Fedora Linux. &nbsp;A friend of mine at work uses Fedora, and recently I had some issue with Mint, at the time my favorite distro, so I deiced to try Fedora out. &nbsp;I also switched over from GNOME, to KDE and that has been a great expierence also. &nbsp;The look and feel are great, and all of the options are really easy to setup compared to some of my recent experiences with&nbsp;GNOME 3 / Unity. &nbsp;I got all of my hot keys setup the way I like and I feel very productive. &nbsp;Anything I could think of I was able to find a program, setting, option or theme for.<br /><br />On top of that, always having the latest and greats programs is really nice. &nbsp;No more trying to figure out how to get the latest version of something and having to do hacky things to make it work. &nbsp;I recently updated from Fedora 19 to 20 on my laptop and had no issues. &nbsp;I went to the wiki, ran the commands it said, after a few minutes I was back in business. &nbsp;Straight forward and easy, couldn't ask for more in an OS. &nbsp;Having Steam run on linux is pretty great too. &nbsp;I've added to my rules of purchasing games, does it run on linux. &nbsp;I don't play many games but all the ones I have purchased from the Humble Bundle have worked so far.<br /><br />TLDR; switched to Fedora, and it's awesome. I would recommend you try it out.
