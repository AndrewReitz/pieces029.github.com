I got tasked with building a website for the Boy Scout Troop I am affiliated with. &nbsp;With that came lots and lots of photos people wanted to view. &nbsp;About 6.6GB in total. &nbsp;These images also needed to be water marked. &nbsp;We are using Square Space because of it's ease of use, but there is no way to have it automatically watermark the images. &nbsp;So I stitched some scripts together and came up with the following.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/pieces029/8270238.js"></script>It's not the prettiest thing I have ever written but it get's the job done. &nbsp;There are a lot more options that could be added in; oh well maybe another day.
