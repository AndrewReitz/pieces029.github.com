I have played with different options for getting Netflix running on Linux, and the best and easiest option I found was to install Windows in Virtual box. &nbsp;Yes, it's not an elegant solution but it works and it works well. Now if you are using Linux you probably don't have a spare Windows key lying around so to get past that hurdle we will use an IE Testing VM.<br /><br />Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads">http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads</a>&nbsp;and download a version of windows you would like. &nbsp;I am using Windows 8 with IE11.<br /><br /><code>wget -i https://az412801.vo.msecnd.net/vhd/VMBuild_20131127/VirtualBox/IE11_Win7/Linux/IE11.Win7.ForLinuxVirtualBox.txt</code><br /><code>chmod +x part1.sfx</code><br /><code>./part1.sfx</code><br /><code><br /></code><code>You will now have an ova file. &nbsp;This file is used to import the VM into virtual box.</code><br /><code><br /></code>Now you will need to install virtual box. &nbsp;This will depend on your distro. &nbsp;I am on fedora so it would be <code>sudo yum install VirtualBox</code>. &nbsp;There might be a little more to it than that depending on your distro/setup.<br /><br />Finally import the ova file. &nbsp;Open up virtual box and go to File -&gt; Import, click next like you would if you were on windows unless you really need to update the vm options. &nbsp;Once complete start up the VM. &nbsp;Once started you can open up IE and navigate to Netflix and give it a try (You can install Chrome, but I'm not sure if that is against the License).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iJ5ovie4j3s/UrfYDIR-_BI/AAAAAAAACrc/td0KbBsda-E/s1600/import_ova.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="198" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iJ5ovie4j3s/UrfYDIR-_BI/AAAAAAAACrc/td0KbBsda-E/s320/import_ova.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />If you want to go full screen or run seemless mode you will need to install guest additions. &nbsp;This can be done by clicking Devices -&gt; Insert Guest Additions CD Image...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Unhpw04-Gxc/UrfYI7vOdYI/AAAAAAAACrk/Gl8QJkxjBAE/s1600/guest_additions.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Unhpw04-Gxc/UrfYI7vOdYI/AAAAAAAACrk/Gl8QJkxjBAE/s320/guest_additions.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />
