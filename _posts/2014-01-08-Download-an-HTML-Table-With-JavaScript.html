I needed to download a list of users for the same website I talked about in my last blog post. &nbsp;For whatever reason Joomla doesn't have an export function. &nbsp;We are using a very old version, I don't know much about Joomla, and I didn't have access to the database. &nbsp;So, I did the only thing I knew how, loop through the table grabbing the values with JavaScript.<br /><br />Here is how I did it. &nbsp;I post it here in hopes that is helpful to someone else, or myself when I forget how I did it in a few days (hello future self).<br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/pieces029/8311393.js"></script>
