A post or two ago I suggested using a VM to run netflix. &nbsp;Although this isn't the most ideal option it does happen to work. &nbsp;Well since then I have found a more ideal option. &nbsp;Some very nice people have created packages for different linux systems that put together wine, silverlight and some other packages to create an easy to install netflix application for your system.<br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/pieces029/8592032.js"></script>
