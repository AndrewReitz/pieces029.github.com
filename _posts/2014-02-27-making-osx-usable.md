## Update

After I posted this my friend Patrick suggested I try [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/). It's a great app and I definatley recomend it!
I use it as a better finder (command + space) replacement, but I bet there is a lot more it can do.

On another note, I have almost adjusted, I still need to find a better virtual desktop manager, and figure out what is up with my colors in the terminal.
My files are properly colored, just directories are, and highlighting in emacs is just not existent.

I have been told by many people when I question about Macs, that they are "just like Linux". Well let me just go ahead and stop you right there. No, they are NOT "just like Linux." Macs are maybe more like Linux than windows, although, I still think that is a stretch.

Anyways, long store short, I received a Mac Book Pro Retina, I gave it a whirl. I hate it, but rather than bitching about how usable it is (seriously I don't know how people even get half the work I can get in a day done on these things), I though I would post a blog about all the apps I used to customize it to make it bearable (Not to sound all high and mighty, but I'm writing this from my 1/3 the cost Asus laptop running Fedora 20).

### The things I installed.

* [**iTerm**](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home)
* [**Homebrew**](http://brew.sh/)
* [**BetterTouchTool**](http://www.bettertouchtool.net/)
* [**Caffeine**](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/)
* [**KeyRemap4MacBook**](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/)
* [**PCKeyboardHack**](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/pckeyboardhack.html.en)
* [**WindowFlow**](http://most-advantageous.com/windowflow/)

1. iTerm is a terminal replacement, the terminal that comes with OSX is like something you would expect from an old Linux distro. This terminal is better, oh so much better!
1. Homebrew is a package manager, it's kinda like yum or app-get, just not as good. It's missing lots of things, and it probably won't stop you from having to (unfortunately) open the App Store, but it will do for getting some of those command line tools that are missing.
1. BetterTouchTool, you know how Windows and different Linux windows managers have windows that snap to corners, half the window and full screen when you drag it to just the right spots. Well OSX doesn't believe in this. Apparently they really don't want you to go full screen. Well this tool brings all of these necessities to OSX. It even lets you set up hot keys. I have my function key + arrows to move my windows around.
1. Caffeine, stops your computer from sleeping. Not really needed but it's nice.
1. KeyRemap4MacBook, exactly like it sounds. Remap your keys to how you want.
1. PCKeyboardHack, really complements KeyRemap4MacBook.
1. WindowFlow, you know how command + tab is suppose to be like alt + tab? Well it's not, the way command + tab works in OSX makes it pretty much impossible to have the 20 terminals open (yes I know alt + \` is suppose to help, but it doesn't! Bringing 20 terminals on top of the browser I was looking at is NOT helpful!). This fixes this problem. Alt + tab now acts like alt top on any other system.

If anyone is still reading this, and is wondering what I didn't like about the Mac. Well the actual hardware itself is great, if I could easily install a normal keyboard I would be using it right now with Fedora 20. But, as you might have guessed, the keyboard, seriously WTF! Where is my numpad, home, end, and insert key? Why is the control key tiny and in the wrong spot, same with the other modifier keys. I know I was told that it actually makes more sense to use command+C for copy.  But in all honesty I find it extremely awkward to keep my fingers on the home row when doing this. And lastly, the operating system, seriously? Apple claims on there website that it's the most advance OS. Maybe apple os. There are so many features and customization that just aren't there. My honest opinion is that it is a very expensive chrome book. Go ahead and call me self-righteous, smug or crazy, but I will stick to my cheaper laptop with the same specs running Fedora, thanks, and I will probably call you a hipster.

Well that's enough for my inebriated rant. #Haters Gotta Hate. I'm off to bed.
