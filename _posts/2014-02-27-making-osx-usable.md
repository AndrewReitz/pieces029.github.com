I have been told by many people when I question about Macs, that they are "just like linux". Well let me get this out there. No, they are not "just like linux", they are maybe more like linux then windows although, I still think that is a stretch.

Anyways, long store short, I recieved a Mac Book Pro, I gave it a whirl. I hate it, but rather than bitching about how unsable it is (seriously I don't know how people get even 1/2 the work I can get in a day done), I though I would post a blog about all the customizations I did to make it bearable (Not to sound all high and mighty, but I'm writting this from my 1/3 the cost asus machine running Fedora 20).

The things I installed.
- iTerm
- Brew
- BetterTouchTool
- Caffeine
- KeyRemap4MacBook
- PCKeyboardHack
- WindowFlow

1. iTerm is a terminal replacement, the terminal that comes with OSX is like something from the 80's. This terminal makes it better, it makes it almost like linux!
1. Brew is a package manager, it's kinda like yum or app-get, just not as good. It's missing lots of things, and it probably won't stop you from having to open the App Store, but it will do to get some of those apps that are missing.
1. BetterTouchTool, you know how windows and different linux windows managers have windows that snap to corners, half the window and full screen when you drag it to just the right spots. Well OSX doesn't believe in this. Apparently they really don't want you to go full screen. Well this tool brings all of these nessesities to OSX. It even lets you set up hot keys. I have my function key + arrows to move my windows around.
1. Caffeine, stops your computer from sleeping. Not really needed but it's nice.
1. KeyRemap4MacBook, exaclty like it sounds. Remap your keys to how you want.
1. PCKeyboardHack, really complements KeyRemap4MacBook.
1. WindowFlow, you know how command + tab is suppose to be like alt + tab? Well it's not, the way command + tab works in osx makes it pretty much impossible to have the 20 terminals I would normally have open (yes I know alt + ` is suppose to help, but it doesn't brining 20 terminals on top of the browser I was looking at is NOT helpful), this fixes it. Alt + tab now acts like alt top on any other system.

If anyone is still reading this, and is wondering what I didn't like about the Mac. Well the actual hardware itself is great, if I could easily install a normal keyboard I would be using it right now with Fedora 20. But, as you might have guessed, the keyboard, seriously WTF! Where is my numpad, home, end, and insert key? Why is the control key tiny and in the wrong spot, same with the other modifyier keys. I know I was told that it actually makes more sense to use command+C for copy.  But in all honesty I find it extreamly akward to keep my fingers on the home row when doing this. And lastly, the operating system, seriously? Apple claims on there website that it's the most advance OS. Maybe apple os. There are so many feautres and customizations that just aren't there. My honest opinion is that it is a very expensive chrome book. Go ahead and call me selfrightous, smug or crazy, but I will stick to my cheaper laptop with the same specs running Fedora, thanks, and I will probably call you a hipster.
