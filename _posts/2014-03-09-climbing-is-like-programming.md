In the last few months I have really gotten into rock climbing. I did it a good amount when I was a kid in Boy Scouts and a little bit my first year in college. I always enjoyed climbing but eventually fell out of it. Well as I have gotten older I realized that snowboarding (my sport of choice) in Minnesota isn't the best. It's always super cold and icy, and unless I am in the park I get bored quickly. I'm getting to old to be getting hurt in the park, so I have slowly been snowboarding less and less, only really getting out a few times a year to some bigger hills. With that being said I needed something to do to get some exercise. A few months back some co-workers decided to take a trip to an indoor climbing place. I immediately fell in love. Which brings me to the point of this post. Rock climbing is like programming.

Programming you have a problem you are faced with, you can solve it thousands of ways, but you want to find the best way, the one that is elegant and beautiful; or maybe just brute force. I don't know your style but hey you can brute force climbing too (please at least make your code readable). This is the reason I enjoy climbing so much, problem solving. I can show up and look at a route, sit there thinking of different moves and try over and over again until I get it. Maybe I did it sloppy, or had to take some breathers, well I can do it again until I get it perfect. I try different moves and eventually come up with one that will take me to the next piece of the challenge. Yes, climbing and programming differ in many ways but the main problem solving aspect is what stands out to me and makes me enjoy it so much.

Oh, lastly the reason I wrote this post! I was at work and a bunch of people were talking about doing some race, a race with running and I started giving them flak for it, since I really don't enjoy running. I find it get's boring very quickly. One of the guys I was giving some grief too turns to me and asks, "why do you climb?"  I responded with, "because it's like programming." I think they get it but had never though about it that way so I though I would share the word.
