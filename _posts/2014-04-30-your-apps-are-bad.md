In this day and age, everyone and everything seems to have an app. As an Android user and developer I try out lots of apps, and unfortunately lots of apps are bad. In this post I want to go over some of the things that annoy me when it comes to apps. If you do any of the following in your app and I use it, I will probably give it 1 - 2 stars. This post is directed towards Android, but some of the points can probably be applied to other platforms.

1. Your app is not the reason I have a smart phone. For whatever reason
designers get it in there head that the sole reason I have a smart phone is for their app. Well let me tell you something (big surprise here) it's not. If your application acts like it's king of the castle and does't play well with other apps, leaves annoying notifications or takes too long to get to the point, I will uninstall it ASAP. Your app should be quick, simple and not intrusive.

1. If you built and Android app, make use of the Android platform. This is said everywhere, but I still see apps ignoring it every day. If I wanted an iOS experience, I would have gotten an iPhone. Utilize what Android gives you. I don't want a uniform experience, in fact, I don't care what the iOS version looks like as long as you keep it out of the Android version. How often do you think I see the two side by side? Probably never, in fact the only people that will be comparing them side by side is your management. If you want everyone to have a uniform experience, build a website. The reason you build an app should be to utilize specific features the platform gives you, to be easier to use than the website. Of course this is best done by following the way everything else on the platform works. Just make sure your app has the same features across all platforms and everything should be good. 

1. Don't make me type. Typing on phones and tablets sucks. Don't make me do it. I'm looking at you, every pizza ordering app in the Play Store. Why do I need to make and account and fill out all this other info just to see the menu. Can you not just use my current location and show me the menu? Then actually make me type in the street address and a few other specifics once I place the order? It's sad that it's still easier to call in, but I digress. Android has many ways to simplify input. Use Google Plus, Facebook or some other social media site for login (a great example is PushBullet, the signup experience is very smooth). I seriously hate making new accounts on mobile devices, well actually anywhere, but more so on mobile devices.

1. Cross platform solutions. Yes I can tell,
and yes they suck (with the exception of games). Build a website.

1. Flashy images, and animations. Subtle little animations are okay, lots just get distracting. Also, make your app work first before making it flashy. A solid working app is way more important than a beautiful app that doesn't do what it's suppose to.

1. Incorrect asset sizes. As I said before but I will say it again, use the Android Platform. Don't just grab the iOS assets and throw them in your app. Get your designer to create the assets for xxhdpi and cut them for each screen density.

1. Asking for permissions your app doesn't need. Why do you need access to my network or to read my location? If your app has a bunch of permissions that aren't obvious as to why they are needed, get rid of them or list the reason in the Play Store.

Well that pretty much sums up my feelings about the current situation with lots of apps I have seen lately. If your manager or designer says/tells you to do one of the above fight them on it! Help make Android a better place, not full of garbage apps. And most importantly read and follow [Android Design Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/design/index.html). Just because you see another app do something, doesn't mean it's good UX. Follow what Google does and try to make the platform consistent.
