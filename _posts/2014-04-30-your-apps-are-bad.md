In this day and age, everyone and everything has an app. As an Android user and developer I see and use lots of apps, and lots of apps are just bad. In this post I want to go over some of the biggest things that annoy me when it comes to apps. If you do any of the following and I use it you will probably be receiving 1 - 2 stars. This is directed towards Android, but many of the principals can probably be applied to other platforms.

1. Your app is not the reason I have a smart phone. For whatever reason
designers get it in there head that the sole purpose I have a smart phone is for their app. Well let me tell you something (big surprise) it's not. If your application acts like it's king of the castle and does't play well with other apps, leaves annoying notifications or takes to long to get to the point, well I will uninstall it ASAP.

1. If you built and Android app, make use of the Android platform. This is said everywhere, but I still see this every day. If I wanted an iOS
experience, I would have gotten an iPhone. Utilize what Android gives you! I don't want a uniform experience, in fact, I don't give two shits what the iOS version looks like or the fact that they don't match. How often do you think I see the two? Probably never, and how often do you hear a user complain that they aren't the same, again probably never. If you want a uniform experience build a website. The reason you build an app should be to utilize some sort of specific features the phone gives you. To become easier to use than the website, and of course this is best done by following the way everything else on the platform works.

1. Don't make me type. Typing on phones and tablets sucks. Don't make me do it. I'm looking at you, every pizza app in the play store. Why do I need to make and account and fill out all this other BS just to see the menu. Can you not just use my current location and show me the menu? Then actually make me type in the street address and a few other specifics once I place the order? It's sad that it's still easier to call in, but I digress. Android has many ways to make the user not have to type. A few good ideas are prepopulate fields whenever possible. Use Google Plus, Facebook or some other social media site for login. I seriously hate making new accounts on mobile devices, well actually anywhere, but more so on mobile devices.

1. Cross platform solutions. Yes I can tell,
and yes they suck (with the exception of games). Build a website.

1. Flashy images, and animations. Subtle little animations are okay, lots just get distracting. Also, make your app work first before making it flashy. A solid working app is way more important than a beautiful app that doesn't do what it's suppose to.

Well that pretty much sums up my feelings about the current situation with lots of apps I have seen lately. If your manager or designer says/tells you to do one of the above fight them on it! Help make Android a better place, not full of garbage apps.
