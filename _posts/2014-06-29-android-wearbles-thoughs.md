I was extremely lucky this year and was able to attend Google I/O, where the
unavailing of Android Wearables took place. With this I was able to choose
between an LG G Watch, or a Samsung Gear Live.

Before I go into which one I choose, and my thoughts on it, I'll go into my
original thoughts of the wearables. I though cool, another place where I will
receive a notifications. I already get notifications on my computers, phone,
and tablet, sometimes through both notifications and emails. WHY ON EARTH
WOULD I NEED ANOTHER PLACE TO GET THESE!?

So back to the main point here. I choose the Samsung Gear Live. For no real reason
in particular. I didn't know much about either of the watches, but did get to see both
of them up close after I made my choice. So on with the differences. They both look pretty similar
square face, black rubber band. The LG is a more standard watch clasp type band where
as the Samsung has a special two prong easy to snap clasp. The Samsungs clasp is
nice since you have to pop it off almost every night for charging, but also a
little worrysome that it may fall of any time.

The chargers also differ in that the Samsung has a snap on back piece that the
micro USB fits into, and the LG's is a easy to connect magnetic connector that
the micro USB goes to. The charger for the LG is a more standard micro USB to
standard USB that then comes with a wall plug. The Samsung is a micro USB to wall.
Points go to the LG in this area.

The only other difference I could really pick up on is that LG did not have a heart
rate sensor. Not really a big deal for me, just some interesting stuff I can
measure, but ultimately just a nice to have.

The battery life so far has been about 1.5 - 2 days depending on how much you use it
and if you leave the screen on. There are settings to either have the screen turn
off when not in use or to just dim it and turn it to black and white. Since it
will not always make it the second day I have found that charging it every night
just like a cell phone is the best option rather then trying to get it charged
half way through the day. This is especially important if you want it to accurately
keep track of your steps.  This is where I think the clasp on the Samsung beats
the LG. It is very easy to pop on and off, and I think anything more time consuming
and charging the battery would have become more of a chore (charging it in general is a chore).

The wearable is pretty nice. The notifications I was complaining about earlier
are generally not things I need to respond to right away. With the watch I can now
just dismiss them right away, and respond to the ones I care about. It's very
convenient to use some of the voice commands too, as long as you aren't around anyone.
In a large crowd talking to my watch, or phone for that matter just makes me feel
like a tool.

There are some niceties about the watch, and I think for 200 bucks it's not a terrible
purchase considering how much you could spend on a non-smart watch. Every day I
feel like I find something new it can do, and I am thinking there is some great
room for cool apps. I was hoping I could hook my own app into the Google Now
features to be able to control other things other than what are just build in to Google Now. But, from
what I gather from reading the docs I don't think that's possible (someone
correct me if I'm wrong). I was also hoping it would help the battery life of my
phone since now I wouldn't be needing to take it out to dismiss the pile of
notifications that stack up or to check the time (for me the screen is the #1 battery eater),
but I haven't really noticed a difference. Can't wait to get my hand on the
Motorola Wearable (360X?) when it comes out, and I recommend checking one out if
you are in the market for a new watch.

Update 7/9/2014
The charger for the Gear Live apparently has some issues, and I am one of the
unfortunate people who broke the tiny little clip on the watch. I am getting it
warrantied and hoping the next one will not be as fragile.

Also, what I have realized about this watch is that it is great for city wear,
but for camping, or other outdoor activities such as rock climbing or canoing,
you may want to leave this at home. The battery life is partially an issue but
it also seems pretty easy to scratch.

(I apologize for spelling and grammar errors I wrote this late at night, and the
  mark down editor I use doesn't have grammar checking).
